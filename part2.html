    Here is an interesting story about a popular sport outside of the United States: cricket.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    A gutsy Beth Mooney has guided the Brisbane Heat to a three-wicket upset of the Sydney Sixers to claim their maiden <abbr title="Women's Big Bash League">WBBL</abbr> title at Drummoyne Oval. 
    Laura Harris hit the winnings runs with four balls remaining when she smashed a four between Erin Burns and Sara McGlashan.<br>
    </p>  
    <p>
    After being set 132 for victory and needing five off the final over, Harris and Delissa Kimmince guided the underdogs over the line against the two-time reigning champions. However Mooney was the hero, defying illness to hit a match-winning 65 off 46 balls in front of a sold out crowd of 5,368 - and several hundred more watching from vantage points outside the suburban ground in Sydney's inner west.<br>
    </p>
    After being outstanding behind the stumps during the Sixers' knock - taking two catches including a ripper to dismiss Erin Burns - Mooney was visibly struggling in the stifling heat. 
    The Brisbane trainers on several occasions ran out drinks to the left-hander and she was frequently down on her haunches.<br>
